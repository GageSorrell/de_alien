Defusal map for *Counterstrike: Global Offensive*.

`de_alien` takes place at a North American research facility operating on captured aliens.  A group of Terrorists have broken in to free the aliens.  Fight in a complex map with multiple routes among breathtaking visuals including alien autopsies, spacecraft, and top-secret technology.

The most unique aspect of this map is its use of portals and jump pads: tedious ladders are gone, and what is more impactful is that B Site is on an alien planet, detached from the rest of the map, and can only be accessed via portals in the map.

## Playtesting

The map can be downloaded from the Workshop, but it will not be the most current iteration of the map; if you want current version, copy the BSP file from the `map/` folder and copy it to your `maps` directory.
