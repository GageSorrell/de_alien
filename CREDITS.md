# Credits

*See *`THANKKS.md`* for a list of playtesters and other feedback-giving people.*

Many textures are from GameTextures.com (these are in a folder blacklisted by `.gitignore`.  All other textures are from the game itself.

Thanks to 3kliksphilip and TopHATTwaffle for great tutorials, as well as various redditors and GameBanan users for their posts.

So far all other work has been by me.  These are the tools that I have used so far:

* Hammer Editor (CS:GO SDK)
* 3Ds Max 2018 (yay Student Licenses)
* Inkscape for basic picture manipulation and planning of map layout
* GIMP for radar creation (Inkscape is used for editing)
* Sculptris for visitor alien creation and custom playermodels
* Github Desktop GUI, because my use of `git` has been very limited so far
* Vim via Cygwin for text editing
